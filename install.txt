Installation.
To install Refal5 you need:
1) to copy makefile.<ext> to makefile, where <ext> corresponds your OS. Now 
   <ext> has followed values: win (for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP), 
                              lin (for Linux/Intel or FreeBSD/Intel);
2) to run   make  (for Linux/Intel) 
       or   nmake (for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP) 
       or   gmake (for FreeBSD/Intel)
3) copy the result of compilation (binary files refc[.exe], refgo[.exe] and 
   reftr[.exe]) to a directory which is reachable through the PATH-environment variable. 

   Or you can create a directory ( let it be REFAL ),where put the binary files, and add 
   c:\REFAL to your search path. Under Windows 95 you can accomplish this by editing your 
   autoexec.bat file and modifying ( or adding ) the line starting with "PATH".
   For example:
   PATH=c:\windows;\c:\REFAL

   Under Windows NT, the same change can made through the control panel. 

   Under Linux you should make this change in the initialization files of whatever 
   shell you use. 
   For example, 
    a) csh and tcsh users will want to make this change in their .cshrc file.
       The following line must be added:
       setenv PATH ($PATH /REFAL)
    b) bash users will want to make this change in their .bash_profile file.
       The following line must be added:
       PATH=$PATH:/REFAL; export PATH
    c) sh users will want to make this change in their .profile file.
       The change will looks like following:
       The following line must be added:
       PATH=$PATH:/REFAL; export PATH

4) copy dynamic libraries xmlparse.dll and xmltok.dll (for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP)
   to a directory which is reachable through the PATH-environment variable. 

Notes: 
1) This version is not supported under MS-DOS.
2) For Windows NT it uses Visual C/C++ (It is recommended the version 6.0).
