			COMMAND  SYNTAX.

  Command names and parameters may appear in either upper or lower case (except 
in pattern specification, where the case is important). Command parameters may
be separated by blanks, tabs or commas. Commands are separated by end-of-lines
or semicolons. To continue the command on the next line type a backslash '\'
in the end of the first line. The dot '.' command repeats the last batch of
commands appearing on the same line. The dot '.' must appear in the first
position of the line (the rest of the line is ignored).
